## Project Name:  Seminole Weather Channel Application

### Course Title:
Web Application Development

### Assignment Date:  
April 6, 2018

### Student Name:  
Barbara Siplin

### Project Description:
The Seminole Weather Channel assignment provided guidance on enhancing an API-centric 
web application.  In this assignment, I made API calls using APIXU.  As I registered
as a free user, the API source is referenced in my assignment.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. API keys are used to track as well as control how the API is being used--for instance
    to prevent malicious abuse of the API's terms of service.
2. The APIXU method returned up to the next 10-day weather forecast as JSON.  The
    data is returned as a forecast object.
3. Guidance, no procrastination (i.e., starting lessons early), practice, patience, 
    and repetition are very important in learning jQuery and Javascript.  The course instructions,
    guidance, and interactive lessons were very instrumental in my completing class
    assignments and course requirements.
